# Model analysis project

My project is titled **SIMULATING THE IS-LM MODEL** and is about a numerical solution of the outcomes of important econommic variables in the IS-LM in five different scenarios.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
